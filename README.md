# PRODIGY_CS_01
This repository contains a Python implementation of Ceaser Cipher algorithm, which allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift key value. The program takes user input for a message and shift key, then performs encryption and decryyption accordingly.

# Caesar Cipher in Python

# Description
This repository contains a Python program that implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm for encryption and decryption. The user can input a message and a shift value to encode or decode text.

## ðŸ”‘ What is Caesar Cipher?
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- `HELLO` â†’ `KHOOR`
- `WORLD` â†’ `ZRUOG`

# Features
- Encrypt a given message using a shift value.
- Decrypt an encrypted message back to its original form.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves spaces and non-alphabetic characters.

# ðŸ›  Usage
# Running the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerSnehasish/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
